The Odin Project - Recipes Project

This project showcases basic HTML skills such as the use of paragraphs, headings, bolding, images, lists, etc. Currently, no CSS styling is used as the focus of this project is only on HTML. Additionally, I practice going through a project development cycle using proper commit messages, etc.

This project contains a main recipes page with subpages that detail various recipes with a description, ingredients, and steps
